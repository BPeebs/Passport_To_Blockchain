The appication will work over a streamlit application where travel ID can be selected, then origin and destination country will be selected.
This will be beneficial and useful individuals who are travel to potentially currupt governments. 
This would create a record of a travelers past destinations and new current destination.
The Ethereum smart contract implements the travel log from country to another.
